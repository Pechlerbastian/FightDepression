### Fight Depression 
The Fight Depression App is a mobile application that is designed to help people struggling with depression. The app is built using Flutter and uses reapprasial statements to improve the user's mood. A daily Depression Training program can be done, which is analysed by a predictive deeplearning model that uses regression to estimate the user's depressive score.

### Features
## Depression Training
The Depression Training program is a daily activity that helps users confront negative thoughts and emotions. Each day, the user is presented with five statements -- one after another -- that are designed to trigger negative thoughts or emotions. The user is then given several reappraisals for each statement, which are positive or neutral statements that can help the user reframe their thinking.

The user selects a reappraisal for each statement and then records themselves reading the reappraisal three times. The app uses a deep learning model to predict the user's depressive score based on the recordings.

## Predictive Model
The app features a predictive model that uses deep learning to estimate the user's depressive score. The model analyzes the user's recordings and uses machine learning algorithms to predict the user's level of depression on a scale from 0 to 10. The app tracks the user's daily scores and displays them in a graph that can be viewed on the main screen.

## Monthly Overview
The user can also view a graph of all their monthly scores by selecting a month on the monthly overview screen. This allows the user to track their progress over time and identify patterns in their mood.

### Technologies
The Fight Depression App is built using Flutter, a popular mobile app development framework that allows for the creation of native apps for iOS and Android using a single codebase. The app uses a deep learning model for depression prediction, which is powered by TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google.

### Getting Started
To get started with the Fight Depression App you have to:
- clone this repository
- install flutter
- use the command flutter pub get in app root
- start a emulator or plug in a mobile phone
- run with the command flutter run or start a debugging session
This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Once the app runs, follow the on-screen instructions to set up your account and begin using the Depression Training program.
